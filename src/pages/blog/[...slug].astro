      title: "Why Do We Dry Needle?",
      subtitle: "Everything you need to know about dry needling.",
      date: "March 14, 2025",
      text: `
          <p>
              Dry needling is a technique used by physical therapists and other healthcare providers to treat
              muscular pain and dysfunction. It involves inserting very thin, solid needles into specific areas of
              muscle tissue, such as trigger points, or muscle knots. When dry needling is applied to your
              muscles and tissues, it can decrease tightness, increase blood flow and reduce local and referred
              pain.
              <br></br>
              Stimulating a trigger point with a needle helps draw normal blood supply back to flush out the
              area and release tension. The prick sensation can also fire off nerve fibers that stimulate your
              brain to release endorphins, your body’s homemade pain medication.
              <br></br>
              <span class="text-secondaryColor uppercase font-bold">Is it Painful?</span>
              <br></br>
              Dry Needling is considered painless by many people. It consists of a very thin needle, a lot
              thinner than a shot. Sometimes, when highly irritable, or when hitting a trigger point, you may
              feel discomfort, after all we are inserting a needle in your body. But often, the idea of the needle
              being inserted in your body is worse than the actual process.
              <br></br>
              <span class="text-secondaryColor uppercase font-bold">What Can Dry Needling Do?</span>
              <br></br>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <span class="uppercase font-bold">1. Pain Relief: </span>
                  Dry needling can reduce pain by targeting muscle knots or trigger points that
                  may be causing discomfort. The process helps release tension and may lead to improved
                  blood flow to the affected area.
              <br></br>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="uppercase font-bold">2. Improved Range of Motion:</span>
                  By relieving muscle tightness and releasing trigger points,
                  dry needling can help improve flexibility and joint movement, making it easier to
                  perform daily activities.

                <li>
                  <span class="uppercase font-bold">3. Increased Muscle Function: </span>
                  The technique can help improve muscle function by
                  addressing muscular imbalances and promoting better coordination between muscles.
                  This can enhance overall strength and performance.
              <br></br>

                <li>
                  <span class="uppercase font-bold">4. Reduced Muscle Spasms: </span>
                  Dry needling helps reduce muscle spasms by stimulating the
                  muscle fibers and encouraging relaxation.
              <br></br>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="uppercase font-bold">5. Accelerated Healing: </span>
                  The insertion of needles can stimulate the body’s healing
                  processes by encouraging blood flow to the area. This can promote faster tissue repair
                  and recovery.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="uppercase font-bold">6. Decreased Inflammation: </span>
                  Dry needling may help reduce inflammation in muscles,
                  which can contribute to pain relief and recovery.
              <br></br>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="uppercase font-bold">7. Chronic Pain Management: </span>
                  For conditions like fibromyalgia, tension headaches, or
                  chronic back pain, dry needling can be a helpful treatment option to reduce ongoing pain
                  and discomfort.
              <br></br>
                </li>
              </ul>
              It is important to note that Dry needling is not the only answer. Dry needling helps reduce your
              pain experience which means that we can begin loading you with strength training and create
              true meaningful change in your recovery.

              You've decided that physical therapy is the right choice for your health and are ready to take the
              next step in improving your quality of life.
              <br></br>
              So, you turn to Google and search for terms like:
              <ul class="text-secondaryColor list-disc ml-12">
                <li>
                  Best Physical Therapist in Centennial

                  Best Physical Therapist in Lone Tree
                </li>
                <li>
                  Best Physical Therapy Clinic near me
                </li>
              </ul>
              <br></br>
              But then, you're overwhelmed by the sheer number of clinics that pop up...
              Before you book your appointment, take a moment to ask yourself a few key questions:
              <ul class="text-secondaryColor list-disc ml-12">
                <li>
                  What makes this physical therapy clinic stand out from the others?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Why should I trust this practice with my injury?
                </li>
              </ul>
              <br></br>
              One important thing to consider is whether the physical therapist specializes in treating your
              specific needs or population. For example, if you're a 30-year-old marathoner with Achilles pain,
              you want a clinic that understands your sport and goals and has the right equipment to support
              your recovery.
              <br></br>
              At Overtime, we make sure all of your questions are answered before your first session. We'll
              start with a discovery call or phone consultation to learn more about you, your goals, and
              whether we're a good fit.
              <br></br>
              This is your chance to share your story, ask any questions, and address any concerns. Tell us
              about your pain, what you enjoy doing, and what you hope to achieve.
              <br></br>
              Once we've gotten to know each other better, we'll schedule your first appointment and let you
              know exactly what to expect.
              <br></br>
              When dealing with pain that's affecting your performance, it's crucial that you feel comfortable
              with your physical therapist and trust their expertise. At Overtime, we pride ourselves on
              providing the highest quality care in South Denver. Your experience with us will be unlike any
              other PT practice—you'll have fun, receive education, and experience real improvements that
              last. Our goal is to help you feel better, stay better, and exceed your goals so you can live your
              best life.
              <br></br>
              Take your time finding the right physical therapist. Do your research, communicate your goals
              clearly, and make sure the person you&#39;re trusting with your recovery understands what’s required
              to get you back on track.
              <br></br>
              Take the first step, we'll help you with the rest.

              Choosing the right physical therapist can be overwhelming, especially when dealing with pain or injury. I's important to feel comfortable, heard, and confident in the care you're receiving. Here are 5 signs that it might be time to find a new PT: <br></br>

              If your PT is busy with emails or documentation during your appointment, it's a sign they're not fully focused on your care. At Overtime, you get their undivided attention for the entire session.

              <br></br>
              If you're seeing a student, aide, or spending most of your session on your own, it's time to find a new provider. At Overtime, you'll always work one-on-one with a Doctor of Physical Therapy for the full hour.

              You need guidance between sessions. If your PT isn't available to answer your questions outside of appointments, consider a provider who offers accessible communication—like at Overtime, where you can reach us anytime.

              Soccer is an exhilarating sport, known for its fast pace, thrilling goals, and incredible athleticism.

              <br></br>
              Ankle sprains are one of the most frequent injuries seen in soccer. They occur when a player
              twists or rolls their ankle during a tackle, a quick pivot, or while making a sharp turn. The
              ligaments in the ankle stretch beyond their normal range, causing pain, swelling, and sometimes
              bruising.

                  <strong>Strengthen your ankles:</strong> Perform exercises like Single leg balance and strengthening,

                <li>

              The hamstring muscles, located at the back of your thigh, are heavily involved in soccer
              movements like sprinting, kicking, and rapid deceleration. A hamstring strain occurs when these
              muscles are overstretched or torn, leading to pain and limited mobility.

              <br></br>
              Knee injuries, especially tears to the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) and MCL (medial
              collateral ligament), are significant setbacks in soccer. These injuries occur when a player
              changes direction suddenly, experiences a hard tackle, or twists their knee awkwardly. ACL tears
              are serious and stressful and often requiring surgery and long recovery periods.

                How to Prevent It:
              </span>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Strengthen the quadriceps and hamstrings: </strong>Focus on strengthening the muscles around
                  the knee to provide better support and stability.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Improve balance and proprioception: </strong>Exercises like single-leg stands and balance
                  boards help you improve body awareness and coordination, reducing the risk of awkward
                  movements.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Gather proper objective measurements from your Sport PT: </strong>At Overtime, we have
                  tools such as Force Plates and Dynamometer Strength Testing to ensure we are strong on
                  both limbs and prepared to stay at peak shape during the season.

                4. Groin Strain: The Inner Thigh Injury
              </span>
              <br></br>
              The groin muscle group (the adductors) plays a key role in movements like passing, shooting,
              and changing direction. A groin strain happens when these muscles are overstretched or torn,
              leading to pain in the inner thigh. This is particularly common in soccer players due to frequent
              lateral movements.

                How to Prevent It:
              </span>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Warm up and stretch: </strong>A proper warm-up, especially with dynamic stretches targeting
                  the groin area, can reduce the risk of injury.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Strengthen the inner thighs: </strong>Perform exercises like adductor squeezes, side lunges, and
                  leg lifts to build strength in the groin muscles.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Increase mobility: </strong>Incorporate mobility drills for the hips and foam rolling into your
                  routine to improve muscle length and minimize tightness.
                </li>

                5. Concussions: The Head Injury
              </span>
              <br></br>
              Concussions are one of the most serious injuries in soccer, affecting players at all levels. Though
              the sport is known for its skill and athleticism, the risk of head injuries is always
              present—especially when players collide, fall, or head the ball. A concussion occurs when a
              blow to the head or body causes the brain to move rapidly inside the skull, leading to temporary
              brain function disruption.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Concussion Protocols: </strong>Make sure players follow strict concussion protocols. If a
                  concussion is suspected, remove the player from the field immediately and have them
                  assessed by a healthcare professional. Never allow a player to return to the game before
                  they're fully cleared.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Strengthening and Conditioning: </strong>A strong neck and shoulder area helps absorb and distribute impact, which can reduce the
                  severity of head injuries. Regular exercises targeting neck stability and core strength can
                  help protect against concussions.
                </li>

                Conclusion: Stay Safe and Play Strong
              </span>
              <br></br>
              While injuries are an inevitable part of sports, taking preventive measures can significantly
              reduce your risk of getting hurt on the field. Incorporating proper warm-up routines, strength
              training, and mobility exercises into your regular routine can keep you playing at your best.
              Remember, always listen to your body, and don't push through pain—early injury detection and
              recovery are crucial for a full recovery and for maintaining long-term performance.
              Whether you&#39;re a competitive player or a weekend warrior, take care of your body, and keep
              enjoying the beautiful game!
